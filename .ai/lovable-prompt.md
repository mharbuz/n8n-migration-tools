### 🎯 Core Value Proposition
Help e-commerce businesses seamlessly migrate between platforms or keep multiple stores in sync — without losing data, without downtime, and without the headache.

### 🏗️ Page Structure & Sections

**1. Hero Section**
- Bold headline: something like *"Switch E-Commerce Platforms Without Losing a Single Order"*
- Subtitle explaining we use n8n-powered automation workflows for reliable, repeatable migrations
- Two CTA buttons: "Explore Migrations" and "Book a Free Consultation"
- Subtle animated background or illustration showing data flowing between platform logos

**2. Supported Platforms**
- Show logos and names of supported platforms: **Magento (Adobe Commerce), PrestaShop, Shopify, WooCommerce**
- Visual matrix or interactive selector: "Migrating FROM → TO" letting users see available paths
- Mention that custom platform pairs can be added on request

**Migration (One-Time Transfer):**
- Full data transfer from Platform A to Platform B
- Ideal for businesses switching platforms permanently
- Includes data validation, mapping, and post-migration verification
- Icon: a moving truck or arrow going one direction

**3. Migration Scope — What Data Gets Moved**
Clearly list the data types covered, organized in categories:

- **Product Catalog:** Products, variants, SKUs, descriptions, images, categories, tags, attributes, pricing (including tier/group pricing), stock/inventory levels
- **Customer Data:** Customer accounts, addresses, customer groups
- **Order History:** Orders, order statuses, invoices, credit memos, shipments, tracking numbers

- **Reviews & Ratings:** Product reviews, customer ratings
- **Promotions:** Discount codes, cart rules, catalog rules, coupon codes

Present this as an expandable accordion or a clean icon grid.

### **How It Works — Choose Your Path**

3. **Test Migration** — You run the migration on a staging/test environment at your own pace, verify the data, and iterate as needed
4. **Go Live** — When you're confident, you run the final migration yourself and switch over
5. **Community Support** — Access to our Discord community and knowledge base for troubleshooting. Optional: purchase ad-hoc support hours if you get stuck

*Best for: Technical teams comfortable with N8N who want full control and lower cost.*
